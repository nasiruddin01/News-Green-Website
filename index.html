            <p>Corona virus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by
              a new virus.
              The disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with symptoms such as a
              cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. You can protect
              yourself by washing your hands frequently, avoiding touching your face
              and avoiding close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell.</p>

          </h3>
          <p>The 149th British Open, golf’s oldest major championship, was
            canceled Monday by the R&A, which conducts the tournament. Citing
            the coronavirus pandemic, officials said that the event, which was
            scheduled to begin July 16, will be
            rescheduled for July 15 to 18, 2021, and return to the southeastern
            coast of England at Royal St. George’s, the course that had been slated to host this year’s tournament.
            The cancellation came less than an hour ahead of announced changes
            to two of the three other men’s golf major tournaments.

          <p>The neuroscientific investigation of emotions is hindered by a lack
            of rapid and precise readouts of emotion states in model organisms.
            Dolensek et al. identified facial expressions as innate and
            sensitive reflections of the internal emotion state in mice
            (see the Perspective by Girard and Bellone). Mouse facial
            expressions evoked by diverse stimuli could be classified into
            emotionlike categories, similar to basic emotions in humans.
            Machine-learning algorithms categorized mouse facial expressions
            objectively and quantitatively at millisecond time scales</p>
